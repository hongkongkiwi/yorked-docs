## Purpose

High-level product vision, business context, and strategic direction. These documents define *what* we're building and *why* — not implementation details.

## Hierarchy Level

**Level 1: Vision/Ideas** — Highest level, sets direction

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `product-vision.md` | Overall product idea, business model, target users |
| `roadmap.md` | Product roadmap with phases and milestones |
| `competitive.md` | Competitive landscape and market positioning |
| `ideas.md` | Future ideas and considerations (NOT committed) |

## How These Relate to Execution

Vision docs feed into `execution/` for phase planning and `specs/` for feature requirements.

When vision changes:
1. Update the relevant vision doc
2. Review impact on `execution/epic-plans/`
3. Update affected `specs/`

## Status

These docs are **planning context** — not contract-authoritative. For committed scope, see `execution/` and `specs/`.
