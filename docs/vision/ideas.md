## Purpose

Capture ideas, hypotheses, and future considerations that are NOT part of the current plan. These are exploratory thoughts, not commitments.

## Guidelines

- Ideas here are **not scheduled** and **not committed**
- Move to `specs/` only when ready to plan implementation
- Keep brief - detail belongs in specs when promoted

3. Update phase in `docs/execution/epic-plans/`
4. Remove from this file
