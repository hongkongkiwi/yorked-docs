Depends On: `docs/execution/README.md`

## Purpose

Epic definitions and canonical maps. Each epic document defines scope, exit criteria, and what "done" looks like.

## Current Epics

| File | Epic | Status |
|------|------|--------|
| `intent-phase-canonical-map.md` | Intent Epic | Active |
| `implementation-plan.md` | MVP Epics Implementation Plan | Planning Context |

## Epic Lifecycle

1. **Draft** — Epic being defined
2. **Active** — Currently executing
3. **Complete** — All exit criteria met
4. **Archived** — Historical reference

## Exit Criteria

Each epic should define:
- Functional requirements
- Quality gates
- Evidence required
- Rollback conditions
