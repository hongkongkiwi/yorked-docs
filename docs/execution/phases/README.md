## Purpose

Phase definitions and canonical maps. Each phase document defines scope, exit criteria, and what "done" looks like.

## Current Phases

| File | Phase | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| `intent-phase-canonical-map.md` | Intent | Active |
| `implementation-plan.md` | Implementation | Planning Context |

## Phase Lifecycle

1. **Draft** — Phase being defined
2. **Active** — Currently executing
3. **Complete** — All exit criteria met
4. **Archived** — Historical reference

## Exit Criteria

Each phase should define:
- Functional requirements
- Quality gates
- Evidence required
- Rollback conditions
